        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Cake, in general, is one of the most universal comfort foods. At its simplest, it’s a baked mixture of flour, eggs, fat, sugar, and a raising agent, but from that basic formula comes endless variety. Cakes can be light and fluffy, dense and moist, plain or heavily decorated, eaten as dessert or even with tea as a quiet snack. Across cultures, cake often represents celebration, comfort, and sharing.
           <br>Plain cake is the most stripped-down and honest version of all that. No icing, no fillings, no fancy extras—just the core ingredients working together. Because there’s nothing to hide behind, a good plain cake really depends on balance: the right amount of sugar for mild sweetness, enough fat for moisture, and proper mixing and baking to give it a soft, tender crumb. When it’s done well, it doesn’t feel boring; it feels comforting and satisfying.

        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>17cm cake tin</li>
          <li>Electric beater or stand mixer</li>
          <li>Kitchen scales</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>unsalted I would add a pinch of salt to the flour</li>
          <li>125 g caster sugar 0.5 Cup | 4.4oz | You can substitute with granuated sugar, although the cake texture is a little better with the finer caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon vanilla essence You can reduce to 1 teaspoon if you don't want too much vanilla flavour</li>
            <li>2 eggs I use size 6 eggs which are medium sized eggs</li>
            <li>250 g self rasing flour</li>
            <li>250 g milk 1 Cup | 8.5 floz | I use full fat milk</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Line the sides and base of your cake tin (I use a 17cm cake tin) You will find instructions for how I line my cake tins in the recipe infomration above.</li>
          <li>Preheat oven to 180 degrees celsius or approx 360 F</li>
          <li>Weigh or measure out the softened room temperature butter and the sugar, and add the vanilla.</li>
          <li>Beat the butter and sugar until well creamed, the mix will get fluffy and will start the colour will change from yellow to closer to white.</li>
          <li>Beat in the eggs, it is best to do this one at a time, otherwise, the creamed mixture can split.</li>
          <li>Fold in the flour, I use a wooden spoon or spatula for this step. I tend to weigh this straight into the bowl you can see the scales in the photo.</li>
          <li>Fold in the milk, again I tend to weigh this in as it saves me dishes and was how my grandma taught me), but you can use cups to measure if you prefer.</li>
          <li>Pour into your lined cake tin and bake at 180 degrees Celsius (360 F) for 40 mins or until when pierced with a skewer in the centre the skewer comes out clean. The cake should be golden in colour.</li>
          <li>Cool in the tin for around 10 minutes before turning out on to a cake rack.</li>
          <li>It can be nice to dust the cool cake with a little icing sugar before serving.</li>
        </ol>
