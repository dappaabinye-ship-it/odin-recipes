            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
              Spaghetti is one of the most versatile foods out there. At its core, it’s just long strands of pasta made from wheat, but it has this amazing ability to absorb flavours and adapt to almost any cuisine. That’s why you’ll see it dressed up in classic Italian sauces like tomato and meat sauce, carbonara, or aglio e olio, but also reimagined far beyond Italy.
                <br>Jollof spaghetti is a perfect example of that reimagination, and honestly, it’s a Nigerian classic at this point. It takes the familiar jollof base—tomatoes, red peppers, onions, oil, and spices—and swaps rice for spaghetti. The result is something that still tastes unmistakably “jollof” but with a different texture and mouthfeel. The spaghetti soaks up the rich, peppery sauce, giving you flavour in every bite.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>1 lb usually 1 box thin spaghetti</li>
                <li>3/4 cups chicken stock I used a home made stock</li>
                <li>5 large about 2 lbs plum/ roma tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 large onion</li>
                <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
                <li>2 scotch bonnet peppers</li>
                <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 tsp bouillon powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
                <li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
                <li>A small handful of basil optional</li>
                <li>Salt to taste</li>
              </ul>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Blend the tomatoes, onions, and peppers until smooth.</li>
              <li>Boil down the tomato sauce on in a pot on medium- high heat until the sauce is about half the amount, and has thickened significantly to look like a paste. This takes about 15-20 minutes, depending on how high the heat is.</li>
                <li>Be sure to stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from burning.</li>
                <li>Once the sauce is reduced, pour in the stock, oil, thyme, curry powder and bouillon. At this stage, taste the sauce and adjust for salt.</li>
                <li>Add in the spaghetti, pushing it down or breaking it to fit into the pot.</li>
                <li>Cover and allow to cook for 5 minutes on low-medium heat.</li>
                <li>After 5 minutes, the pasta should be soft enough to stir. Stir, turn down the heat to low, and allow to cook for another 8-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>After 8 minutes, stir, and the pasta should be cooked. If it is not, add in a splash (about 1/4 cup) of water and continue to cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>If you choose to add basil, add it in at this stage, and then serve.</li>
            </ol>
